								<h2><strong>Abstract:</strong></h2>
								<p>Blockchains are public ledgers of transactions verified through the use of public and
									private keys to sign and prove ownership of transaction data. Popular blockchains
									have hundreds of millions of transactions which include some of the most popular --
									Bitcoin, Waves, Ripple, ZCash, Monero and Ethereum. Currently, on the Ethereum

								<h2><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
								<p>This paper focuses on our discovery of private keys used to commit Ethereum
									blockchain transactions. The probability of encountering a private key that
									corresponds to someone else’s Ethereum address is around 1 in 2<sup>256</sup>. To
									cover just 1% of that key space, even if we used computing resources that would
									allow us to generate 100 trillion keys per second, it would take us roughly  years.
									However, instead of attempting to brute force search random private keys, we devised
									ways to discover keys that may have been generated using faulty code, faulty random
									number generators, or a combination of both. The following sections outline how an
									Ethereum address is generated and our approach to discover those private keys that
									were generated in suboptimal ways.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h2><strong>Background:</strong></h2>
								<p>The Ethereum project uses elliptic curve cryptography to generate the public/private
									key pair. The 256-bit private key is used to compute a point on the secp256k1 ECDSA
									curve to generate the public key. The public key is then hashed using keccak256.
									That hash is truncated to the lower 160 bits to produce the public Ethereum address.
									The Ethereum address cannot be reversed back into a public key, nor can the Ethereum
									address be used in any way to derive the underlying private key that was used to
									generate it.</p>
								<p>Given a randomly generated private key, , that is within the valid range of one to
									the maximum value defined by the secp256k1 curve,
									<span style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364140</span>,</p>
								<p>we can calculate the public Ethereum address by taking the lower (right most) 160
									bits of the keccack256 hash of the public key, as defined by:</p>

								<p>Knowing this algorithm, the goal of our research was to find Ethereum addresses that
									could not have plausibly been generated by a correct implementation of the
									algorithm, or, that were correctly derived from non-random private keys.</p>
								<h2></h2>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h2><strong>Experiment Design:</strong></h2>
								<p>The Ethereum blockchain allows anyone to query an address for information<a
										href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, such as balances, transfers,
									and committed transactions. This is done by querying an Ethereum node which can be
									run locally or remotely. Or for ease of use, several online services encapsulate the
									underlying data via web interfaces. One such tool, Etherscan [1], can be used to
									query the public Ethereum address from the above example:</p>
								<ul>
									<li style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">A99FDD90FF61DD08CF049155D18E086F7806641B</li>
								</ul>
								<p style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">One can navigate to
									https://etherscan.io/address/A99FDD90FF61DD08CF049155D18E086F7806641B and see that,
									not surprisingly, there are 0 transactions for this address<a href="#_ftn2"
										name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.</p>
								<p><img class="aligncenter img-fluid wp-image-1452"
										src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png" alt="Figure 2. Etherscan.io lookup of
										A99FDD90FF61DD08CF049155D18E086F7806641B." width="251" height="141" />
								</p>
								<p class="text-center" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><em>Figure 2. Etherscan.io lookup of
										A99FDD90FF61DD08CF049155D18E086F7806641B.</em></p>
								<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
									https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/</p>
								<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> At the time of this writing, there were no
									transactions at this address. However, as the key is now disclosed in this paper,
									the address is public and may have since then been used for transactions. This key
									and Ethereum address should no longer be used for performing Ethereum transactions!
								</p>
								<p>With nearly 50 million public Ethereum addresses having recorded transactions on the
									Ethereum blockchain, it is likely that we may encounter keys that are weak or lack
									randomness, due to several possible factors. An obvious one is key truncation. That
									is, where a random 256-bit private key is generated but only a small subset is used
									due to coding/complier/framework or other unknown errors.</p>
								<p>For example, a 256-bit private key with the value of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x47579DA2BEA463533DBFAD6FCF8E90876C2FE9760DC1162ACC4059EE37BDDB5C</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If truncated to 32 bits, would result in the following key:</p>
								<ul>
									<li style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000037BDDB5C</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In an experiment, we picked a private key of 1, for no reason other than that it is
									the lower bound of a possible private key for secp256k1 and it also lies within the
									1 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1 range of a 32-bit truncated key. We use the private key
									<span style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001</span> to derive the
									public Ethereum address <span style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x7e5f4552091a69125d5dfcb7b8c2659029395bdf</span>.</p>
								<p>As previously discussed, recall the infinitesimal probability of two Ethereum users
									generating the same private key—assuming at least one user is generating them
									randomly. It should not matter whether we explore the key space from the lower
									bound, upper bound, keys using the digits of pi, randomly, or so on—there should be
									no coincidences with another Ethereum user’s randomly generated key. Instead, using
									Etherscan.io to query transaction data on the above public address derived from a
									private key of 0x01 we are presented with the following evidence of a collision with
									our intentionally generated key (i.e., the key is or was in use):</p>

								<p>ISE revealed that there are 592 transactions on an Ethereum address derived from a
									private key of 0x01, and no Ether currently stored at that address. If a private key
									is chosen at random then the chances of someone else generating that same key are
									approximately 1 in 2<sup>256</sup>, which is for all practical purposes a 0% chance.
									Since a private key of 0x01 has approximately zero percent chance of occurring
									randomly, we must assume this value was either chosen on purpose or due to an error.
									The following sections detail our search to understand and examine how widespread
									the generation of weak keys is in the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
								<h2></h2>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h2><strong>Scope of Research:</strong></h2>
								<p>Our research sought to locate Ethereum addresses based on the use of weak keys, and
									to examine how those addresses are used. While it is improbable that a weak key
									would ever be generated under legitimate circumstances using the appropriate code
									paths, we hypothesized that weak private keys may still be generated by coding
									mistakes, or operating system, device, and execution environment errors, and that
									these issues are common. Aside from key truncation, some other common mistakes that
									could weaken 256-bit keys are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Code logic errors</li>
									<li>Type confusion</li>
									<li>Entropy errors</li>
									<li>Random device errors</li>
									<li>Poorly handled exceptions</li>
									<li>Memory reference errors</li>
									<li>Memory corruption</li>
									<li>Seed Re-use</li>
									<li>Malware compromise</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Due to limited computing resources, it is not feasible to enumerate all keys even in
									a much smaller 64-bit key space. So, instead we focus on the achievable: enumerating
									keys that would appear in a smaller 32-bit subset of the 256-bit private key. This
									amounts to 4,294,967,295 private keys for which we will need to calculate the
									corresponding public Ethereum address for and query the blockchain.</p>
								<h2></h2>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h2><strong>Methodology:</strong></h2>
								<p>To perform bulk scanning of potential Ethereum addresses, it is impractical, and even
									abusive in terms of resource usage, to query an online service like Etherscan.
									Instead, we generated an in-memory hash map of all public Ethereum addresses and
									queried this in-memory data structure for each enumerated key. On a local mid-range
									laptop this resulted in a performance of  roughly 15,000 key generations and lookups
									per second, per CPU core, with the bottleneck being the ECDSA private to public key
									generation portion.</p>
								<p>We focus on eight 32-bit “sub-regions” in the 256-bit key space where we are likely
									to observe Ethereum addresses in use that have resulted from a weak private key. We
									expected that the lower 32-bit portion of the key space would be most likely to
									contain weak keys; to account for endianness, we also scanned the upper 32-bit
									portion, and for thoroughness we tested each distinct section of the 256-bit key
									space with a 32-bit window which may yield keys. To illustrate the regions we
									scanned, Figure 4, below, depicts each region we have identified for enumeration.
									While enumerating the 32-bit key space of each region (A through H) we leave the
									remaining 224 bits of the 256-bit key set to 0x00.</p>

								<p>This gives us eight regions with a possible 2<sup>32</sup> -1 (i.e., ~4.3 billion)
									combinations per region. Translating the region definitions into explicit private
									key ranges, we scanned and tested these key ranges for transaction activity on the

								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h2><strong>Results:</strong></h2>
								<p>We discovered 49,060 transactions spread over 732 public keys for which we have the
									private key, with a total transfer amount of more than 32 Ethereum. The present-day
									balance across these keys was 0 Ethereum, however that balance is volatile since
									there are daily transfers in and out of those addresses.</p>
								<p>Present day balances for other types of cryptocurrency across these 732 public keys
									amounted to 60,286,012 ERC-20<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref1">[3]</a> based tokens.
									Tokens exist on Ethereum via smart contracts. However, enumerating all ERC-20 based
									transactions and the sum of those transactions is beyond scope of this research and
									may be included in follow up future work.</p>
								<p>The figure below, Figure 5, is a graphical depiction of the 732 private keys we
									discovered that were used for blockchain transactions. The y-axis is the value of a
									key at its corresponding group offset, and the keys are plotted from left to right

								<p>Groups B through G are merged into a single section since they only yielded 4 private
									keys that committed 29 transactions on the blockchain. The total amount of ETH
									transferred was &lt;0. This result was not surprising as we expected to find a
									majority of our findings to be in either end of the 256-bit key space via our narrow
									32-bit window. Interestingly, one key in these groups, key value of 0x0a000000 in
									group B had an outgoing transfer to an address that currently holds 44,744 ETH, more
									on that later. Figure 9 illustrates these 4 keys and their respective offset of

								<h2><strong>Analysis and Observations:</strong></h2>
								<p>Fortunately, using weak private keys is not a widespread problem. However, it was
									surprising to encounter 732 private keys that we could access. It is also surprising
									to see a combined transaction volume of 49,060. Apparently, there are transactions
									committed to these weak keys every day, and potentially new weak keys being
									introduced as time goes on. The total computing time to scan 8 regions of the
									256-bit key space via 32-bit windows, or regions, was ~128 CPU hours per region or
									1024 hours total. Luckily, this task can be split up and run in parallel and we were
									able divide and scan all 8 32-bit regions which resulted in generating and checking
									~34.3 billion keys in an 8-hour period. So, it is feasible to run periodic checks to
									identify new private keys that have been introduce in future works.</p>
								<p><em>“Blockchainbandit”</em></p>
								<p>Previously, we noted an address in group B at offset 0x04000000 that was interacted
									with via an outbound transaction to a destination address of
									0x957cd4ff9b3894fc78b5134a8dc72b032ffbc464, an individual we refer to as the
									‘blockchainbandit’. After a cursory examination of this transaction, we discovered
									that the destination address belongs to an individual or group that is running
									active campaigns to compromise/gather private keys and take these funds. Since the
									price of Ethereum varies wildly over time, this group or individual has held at
									most,  $54,343,407 worth of ETH, and currently, due to a major market correction,
									$6.1 million through a present balance of 44,744 ETH.</p>
								<p>Noting that the ‘blockchainbandit’ has amassed millions worth of Ethereum through
									~5,400 transactions, we wanted to see how quickly funds would be looted if we
									populated an Ethereum address we hold common knowledge of the private key to.</p>
								<p>Both ISE and the ‘blockchainbandit’ have knowledge of the following private key:</p>
								<ul>
									<li style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00000000000000</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Which is represented by the following derived Ethereum address:</p>
								<ul>
									<li style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x4c636a08fdf3692a9bca111e8a7f4a0e28eb4457</li>
								</ul>
								<p>ISE sent ~1$ worth of Ethereum to 0x4c636a08fdf3692a9bca111e8a7f4a0e28eb4457, an
									address that was last interacted with over 285 days ago on June 7, 2018. The
									‘blockchain’ bandit instantly sent an outbound transaction from this address to
									their holding address of  0x957cd4ff9b3894fc78b5134a8dc72b032ffbc464. Figure 12, is
									an excerpt from Etherscan.io detailing these series of events<a href="#_ftn4"

								<p>While performing additional research to get a grasp on why or how these weak keys are
									being generated, we also encountered additional, more devastating issues dealing
									with passphrase wallets, faulty address generation, and faulty destination address
									targets that are outlined in the sections below.</p>
								<p><em>Parity Wallet with Empty Passphrase</em></p>
								<p>The Ethereum address <span style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72</span> is derived from a

									which is generated from an empty recovery phrase (“”) using the Parity wallet. There
									have been 8772 transactions on this address with a total of 5215.586 Ethereum
									transferred. This address is very active and being monitored for inbound
									transactions which are immediately transferred out by one of many private key
									holders watching this address. The below figure (Figure 13) illustrates a monthly
									transaction count since this address was first used on the Ethereum blockchain in
									March of 2017.</p>

								<p><em>Ethereum Address Corresponding to Null Public Key</em></p>
								<p>The Ethereum address of 0xdcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470 (PubHashEmptyStr)
									is derived from a keccak256 hash performed on an empty “” string, instead of an
									ECDSA public key<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref1">[5]</a>. This address has had
									815.643 ETH transferred to it over 28 transactions spanning roughly 3 years that is
									irrecoverably lost.</p>
								<p style="overflow-wrap: break-word;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn1">[5]</a>
									https://twitter.com/cyrus/status/978775247334748160?lang=en</p>
								<p><em>All-Zero Ethereum Address</em></p>
								<p>The Ethereum address <span style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000</span> (EthAddrNull) has had
									Ethereum erroneously transferred to it. It is all but certain that this was due to
									user or code error where a null destination address was provided. This address has
									had 7289.472 Ethereum transferred to it over 1169 transactions spanning roughly
									three years that is irrecoverably lost.</p>
								<h2></h2>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>
								<p>Through the enumeration of select areas in the 256-bit private key space where errors
									are likely result in the use of weak keys, we have discovered 49,060 transactions
									spread over 732 public keys for which we have the corresponding private keys, with a
									total transfer amount of over 32 Ethereum.</p>
								<p>Additionally, we found other addresses that exist and have been erroneously used when
									transferring Ethereum, the most damaging, in terms of ETH potentially exposed to
									theft, is the Parity derived Ethereum address that is based on an empty string
									passphrase (e.g. “”). This address has had 5215.586 Ethereum transferred to it which
									as of March 2019 is worth 730,182 USD. Any Ethereum transferred to this address can
									be transferred out by individual in possession of the Ethereum private key that was
									derived from an empty Parity passphrase.</p>
								<p>Moreover, there have been a combined total of 8,105 Ethereum transferred to the
									following two addresses:</p>
								<ul>
									<li style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (PubAddrNull)</li>
									<li style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">0xdcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470 (PubHashEmptyStr)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The above addresses had over 1197 transactions spanning over three years. Any
									Ethereum transferred to these addresses are irrevocably lost as there are no known
									private keys that correspond to them. It is beyond current computing resources to
									try to enumerate private keys in order to locate the correct corresponding public
									keys. It is worth noting that in a large-scale event where large sums of Ethereum
									are erroneously lost or transferred it may be possible to lobby the Ethereum
									governing body, made up of node operators, to perform a hard fork. That is, to
									create a new version of the blockchain that would reverse any effects of the error.
									One such event happened in 2016 when a hard fork was performed on the Ethereum
									blockchain to reverse the effects of the DAO attack [3].</p>
								<p>At the height of the Ethereum market, when 1 Ethereum had a market value of
									approximately 1432.00 USD, on January 13 2018, the combined losses of either using
									erroneous destination addresses or using wallets derived from weak or known keys
									amounted to 13,319 Ethereum valued at $18.8 million, and the address behind the
									active hacking campaign we stumbled onto, at the height of the Ethereum market was
									holding $54.3 million.</p>
								<p>Due to the popularity and easy monetization of cryptocurrencies combined with the
									evidence that there are highly successful hacking campaigns ongoing to steal these
									virtual currencies, it should be concluded that any systems that handle private keys
									will be at an increased threat for targeted attacks. Software developers that design
									software or systems that interact with highly valuable private keys should
									incorporate all available defense in depth principles to counter present threats and
									use innovative measures to counter advanced present and future threats against these
									high value assets.</p>
								<h2></h2>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h2><strong>Future Work:</strong></h2>
								<p>Any implementation that uses public key signing based on ECDSA or similar
									cryptographic algorithms can be examined for key generation errors. The obvious
									examples would be other blockchain implementations such as Bitcoin, Waves, Ripple,
									ZCash, Monero, among others.</p>
								<p>It may also be worth exploring source code repositories and/or analyzing
									Android/iOS/Windows applications for use of hard coded private keys. Additionally,
									there may be cases where weak or manually generated test keys used on test
									blockchain networks may have migrated to production code.</p>
								<p>While the legality of transferring crypto currency tokens from addresses that are
									stumbled upon through the enumeration of private keys is uncertain, it may be worth
									exploring activities surrounding the keys discovered in our research. However, it
									appears that the pilfering or camping on a private or group of private keys to watch
									inbound transactions and immediately issue an outbound transaction is very
									profitable (at least in one instance we identified). Investigating the interactions
									between poorly generated private keys and their destinations may reveal patterns
									that may allude to larger scale activities that are currently not well understood or
									documented. Law enforcement or individuals wishing to pursue civil action to reclaim
									crypto currency tokens may have an interest in such research or tools to help
									identify patterns and destination addresses used by individuals or organizations
									involved in the theft of these virtual currencies.</p>
