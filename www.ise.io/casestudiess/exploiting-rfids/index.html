								<h2><a name="about"></a>About RFIDs and the Texas Intruments DST</h2>
								<hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
								<p>Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a general term for small, wireless devices
									that emit unique identifiers upon interrogation by RFID readers. Ambitious
									deployment plans by Wal-mart and other large organizations over the next couple of
									years have prompted intense commercial and scientific interest in RFID. The form of
									RFID device likely to see the broadest use, particularly in commercial supply
									chains, is known as an EPC (Electronic Product Code) tag. This is the RFID device
									specified in the Class 1 Generation 2 standard recently ratified by a major industry
									consortium known as EPCglobal. EPC tags are designed to be very inexpensive -- and
									may soon be available for as little as five cents/unit in large quantities according
									to some projections. They are sometimes viewed in effect as wireless barcodes: They
									aim to provide identification, but not digital authentication. Indeed, a basic EPC
									tag lacks sufficient circuitry to implement even symmetric-key cryptographic
									primitives.</p>
								<p>The term RFID, however, denotes not just EPC tags, but a spectrum of wireless devices
									of varying capabilities. More sophisticated and expensive RFID devices can offer
									cryptographic functionality and therefore support authentication protocols. One of
									the most popular of such devices is known as a Digital Signature Transponder (DST).
									Manufactured by Texas Instruments, DSTs are deployed in several applications that
									are notable for wide-scale deployment and the high costs (financial and otherwise)
									of a large-scale security breach. These include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Vehicle Immobilizers:</b> More than 150 million vehicle immobilizer keys
										shipped with many current automobiles, including e.g. 2005 model Fords, use
										Texas Instruments low-frequency RFID transponders. This number includes systems
										with fixed-code transponders that provide no cryptographic security, as well as
										newer models equipped with DSTs. Immobilizers deter vehicle theft by
										interrogating an RFID transponder embedded in the ignition key as a condition of
										enabling the fuel-injection system of the vehicle. The devices have been
										credited with significant reductions in auto theft rates, as much as 90%.</li>
									<li><b>Electronic Payment:</b> DSTs are used in the ExxonMobil SpeedPass system,
										with more than seven million cryptographically-enabled keychain tags accepted at
										10,000 locations worldwide.</li>
								</ul>
								<p> </p>
								<p>A DST consists of a small microchip and antenna coil encapsulated in a plastic or
									glass capsule. It is a <i>passive</i> device, which is to say that it does not
									contain an on-board source of power, but rather receives its power from the
									interrogation signal transmitted by the reading device via electromagnetic
									inductance. This design choice allows for a compact design and long transponder
									life.</p>
								<p>A DST contains a secret, 40-bit cryptographic key which is field-programmable via RF
									command. In its interaction with a reader, a DST emits a factory-set (24-bit)
									identifier, and then authenticates itself by engaging in a challenge-response
									protocol. The reader initiates the protocol by transmitting a 40-bit challenge. The
									DST encrypts this challenge under its key and returns a 24-bit response. It is thus
									the secrecy of the key that ultimately protects the DST against cloning and
									simulation.</p>

								<h2><a name="attacks"></a>Our Attacks</h2>
								<hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
								<p>The encryption algorithm used in the TI DST tags is an unpublished, proprietary
									cipher that uses a 40-bit key. The algorithm was designed in the early 1990's by
									engineers at Texas Instruments, but is still being deploying in current systems. By
									today's standards, a 40-bit key is unacceptably short: advances in computing power
									have made such keys susceptible to brute-force key guessing attacks. Therefore, the
									actual security of the DST system rests with the secrecy of the proprietary
									algorithm used in the tags. One of the most important principles in cryptographic
									design states, however, that the security of a system should be based only on the
									secrecy of the keys, never on the secrecy of the algorithm.</p>
								<p>We used some new special-purpose cryptanalytic techniques to reconstruct the
									algorithm used in the DST tags, by simply observing the responses that actual DST
									tags computed when presented with a large number of specially chosen challenges.
									Using this <i>black-box</i> reverse-engineering method, we were able to implement a
									software program that, when given the same challenge and key as an actual tag, would
									compute the same response.</p>
								<p>Our next step was to recover the secret key from a deployed DST device, using a
									brute-force key search. Unfortunately, it would have taken more than 2 weeks for our
									software implementation to find a key when running on 10 very fast PCs. We therefore
									implemented our key-search on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA
									evaluation board we used is available online for under $200 in single quantities
									with all of the neccesary development software and cabling. Our implementation
									cracks 32 keys in parallel on a single FPGA running at 100MHz. At this rate, a
									single FPGA is expected to crack a key in just over 10 hours.</p>
								<p>To decrease this key-cracking time even further, we connected 16 FPGAs together at a
									total cost of under $3,500. Texas Instruments provided us with 5 DST tags whose keys
									we did not know. The 16-way parallel cracker was able to recover all 5 keys in well
									under 2 hours.</p>
								<p>We are currently developing and testing even faster and cheaper methods for
									recovering DST keys and will update this page with these results when they become
									available. The details are available in our <a
										href="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/07/tiris.pdf" target="_blank"
										rel="noopener noreferrer">academic paper</a>.</p>
								<p>After recovering a key, in order to attack a real DST system, we needed to create a
									radio device that could speak the same protocol as a hardware DST tag. This device
									would allow us to quickly extract the information needed to recover a key from a
									target DST device, and once the key was cracked, completely emulate the DST to a
									legitimate reader.</p>
								<p>To accomplish this, we equipped a small and easily portable PC with a Measurement
									Computing digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) board; this board is also capable of
									analog-to-digital conversion. The DAC board can perform 12-bit A/D conversions on an
									input signal at a rate of 1.25 MHz and can perform D/A conversions and generate an
									output signal at a rate of 1 MHz.</p>
								<p>We connected the input and output channels on our DAC board to an antenna tuned to
									the correct frequency range. We wrote modulation and demodulation software routines
									to decode and produce the analog AM signals transmitted by the TI reader as well as
									FM-FSK analog signals transmitted by the transponders. Using these routines, our
									equipment can eavesdrop on the communication protocol between a DST reader and
									transponder, or participate actively in a protocol by emulating either device. More
									details on this software radio solution are available in the <a
										href="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/07/tiris.pdf" target="_blank"
										rel="noopener noreferrer">academic paper</a>.</p>
								<p>To validate our attack, we extracted the key from our own SpeedPass token and
									simulated it in our independent programmable RF device. We purchased gasoline
									successfully at an ExxonMobil station multiple times in the course of a single day
									using this digital simulator. Similarly, we recovered the cryptographic key from a
									DST in the ignition key of our 2005 model Ford Escape SUV. By simulating the DST, we
									spoofed the immobilizer authentication system and started the vehicle with a bare
									ignition key, that is, with one that possessed no DST at all. Viewed another way, we
									created the pre-conditions for hot-wiring the vehicle.</p>

								<h2><a name="signifigance"></a>Practical Signifigance</h2>
								<hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
								<p>Our attack on the DST cipher by no means implies wholesale dismantling of the
									security of the SpeedPass network, nor easy theft of automobiles. The cryptographic
									challenge-response protocols of DST devices constitute only one of several layers of
									security in these systems. The SpeedPass network has on-line fraud detection
									mechanisms loosely analogous to those employed for traditional credit-card
									transaction processing. Thus an attacker that simulates a target DST cannot do so
									with complete impunity; suspicious usage patterns may result in flagging and
									disabling of a SpeedPass device in the network. The most serious system-wide threat
									lies in the ability of an attacker to target and simulate multiple DSTs, as
									suggested in our example scenarios below.</p>
								<p>In some sense, the threat to automobile immobilizers is more serious, as: (1) An
									automobile is effectively an off-line security system and (2) A single successful
									attack on an automobile immobilizer can result in full compromise of the vehicle.
									While compromise of a DST does not immediately permit theft of an automobile, it
									renders an automobile with an immobilizer as vulnerable to theft as an automobile
									without one. Such a rollback in automobile security has serious implications. As
									noted above, significant declines in automobile theft rates - up to 90% - have been
									attributed to immobilizers during their initial introduction. Even now, automobile
									theft is an enormous criminal industry, with 1,260,471 automobile thefts registered
									by the FBI in 2003 in the United States alone, for a total estimated loss of $8.6
									billion.</p>
								<p>Extracting the key from a DST device requires the harvesting of two
									challenge-response pairs. As a result, there are certain physical obstacles to
									successful attack. Nonetheless, bypassing the cryptographic protections in DST
									devices results in considerably elevated real-world threats.</p>
								<p>There are effectively two different methods by which an attacker may harvest signals
									from a target DST, and two different corresponding physical ranges.</p>
								<p> </p>
								<p>
									<center><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sniffing_small.jpg"

								</p>
								<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>The equipment needed to capture the data
											required to clone a DST tag at close range. From left, a microreader, a
											laptop, and a serial cable.</b></span></p>
								<p> </p>
								<p>The first mode of attack is <i>active scanning</i>: The attacker brings a reader in
									her control within scanning range of the target DST. DSTs of the type found in
									SpeedPass and automobile ignition keys are designed for short range scanning - on
									the order of a few centimeters. In practice, however, a longer range is achievable.
									In preliminary experiments, we have achieved an effective range of several inches
									for a DST on a keyring in the pocket of a simulated victim using a tiny antenna. A
									DST may respond to as many as eight queries per second. Thus, it is possible to
									perform the two scans requisite for our simulation attacks in as little as
									one-quarter of a second. At the limit of the range achievable by a given antenna,
									however, scanning becomes somewhat unreliable, and can require more time.</p>
								<p>The second mode of attack is <i>passive eavesdropping</i>. Limitations on the
									effective range of active scanning stem from the requirement that a reader antenna
									furnish power to the target DST. An attacker might instead eavesdrop on the
									communication between a legitimate reader and a target DST during a valid
									authentication session. In this case, the attacker need not furnish power to the
									DST; the effective eavesdropping range then depends solely on the ability to
									intercept the signal emitted by the DST. We have not performed any experiments to
									determine the range at which this attack might be mounted. It is worth noting
									purported U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports, however, of successful
									eavesdropping of this kind on 13.56 Mhz tags at a distance of some tens of feet. The
									DST, however, operates at 134 kHz. Signals at this considerably lower frequency
									penetrate obstacles more effectively, which may facilitate eavesdropping; on the
									other hand, larger antennas are required for effective signal interception.</p>
								<p>Only careful experimentation will permit accurate assessment of the degree of these
									two threats. Our cursory experiments, however, suggest that the threats are well
									within the realm of practical execution.</p>

								<h2><a name="fixes"></a>Fixes</h2>
								<hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
								<p>The most straightforward architectural fix to the problems we describe here is
									simple: The underlying cryptography should be based on a standard, publicly
									scrutinized algorithm with an adequate key length, e.g., the Advanced Encryption
									Standard (AES) in its 128-bit form, or more appropriately for this application,
									HMAC-SHA1. From a commercial standpoint, this approach may be problematic in two
									respects. First, the required circuitry would result in a substantially increased
									manufacturing cost, and might have other impacts on the overall system architecture
									due to increased power consumption. Second, there is the problem of backwards
									compatibility. It would be expensive to replace all existing DST-based immobilizer
									keys. Indeed, given the long production cycles for automobiles, it might be
									difficult to introduce a new cipher into the immobilizers of a particular make of
									vehicle for a matter of years. TI has indicated to the authors that they have more
									secure RFID products available at present; in lieu of specifying these products,
									they refer to the site <a href="http://www.ti-rfid.com/" target="_blank"
										rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ti-rfid.com</a> for information.</p>
								<p>In fact, RFID chips with somewhat longer key-lengths are already available in the
									marketplace and used in a range of automobile immobilizers. Philips offers two
									cryptographically enabled RFID chips for immobilizers. The Philips HITAG 2, however,
									has a 48-bit secret key, and thus offers only marginally better resistance to a
									brute-force attack-- certainly not a comfortable level for long-term security. The
									Philips SECT, in contrast, has a 128-bit key. The HITAG 2 algorithm is proprietary,
									while Philips data sheets do not appear to offer information about the cryptographic
									algorithm underpinning their SECT device. It is difficult to say, therefore, whether
									these algorithms are well designed.</p>
								<p>Faraday shielding offers a short-term, partial remedy. In particular, users may
									encase their DSTs in aluminum foil or some suitable radio-reflective shielding when
									not using them. This would defend against active scanning attacks, but not against
									passive eavesdropping. Moreover, this approach is rather inconvenient, and would
									probably prove an unworkable imposition on most users. A different measure worth
									investigation is the placement of metal shielding in the form of a partial cylinder
									around the ignition-key slot in automobiles. This could have the effect of
									attenuating the effective eavesdropping range.</p>
								<p>In the long-term, the best approach is, of course, the development of solid,
									well-modeled cryptographic protocols predicated on industry-standard algorithms,
									with key lengths suitable for long-term hardware deployment.</p>
