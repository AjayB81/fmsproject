                    <p>
                        I'm excited for us to talk about this enormous topic that impacts most major companies yet, at
                        times, can also sound like a very unsexy topic. And it's this idea of third-party risk
                        management/vendor risk management. So first of all, why don't you maybe just briefly introduce
                        yourself and kind of sum up your background, and then we'll get into a few questions I have?

                    <p>
                        Sure. So like you mentioned, I'm currently Head of Security at a startup called Copado, kind of
                        a pre-IPO DevOps startup. I just joined Copado, about three months ago, prior to that, I spent
                        10 and a half years at Salesforce, where I owned their third-party vendor security program, as
                        well as application security and some other things.

                    <p>
                        Cool. So maybe let's start there. Right, so running a third-party risk management program at a
                        company as large as Salesforce, you know, with deployments and integrations all over the planet,
                        what was the biggest challenge that you saw, trying to deal with the complexity of a problem at
                        that scale?
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="pb-3">

                    <p>
                        It's always a balance between the amount of time you can invest to go deep on any given specific
                        vendor versus the scale. You get hundreds of requests a month, and you can only do so much with
                        the resources that you have. So we're constantly trying to walk that line between going deep
                        enough to really understand the impact a new vendor would have on the company versus keeping up
                        with and not delaying the business objectives of the company.

                        So how does one do that? You don't have to, of course, reveal any proprietary secrets from
                        Salesforce. But you know, what are the principles of how you sort through that trade-off?

                        First, I really liked building processes, consistent, scalable processes that are effective and
                        kind of support business partners. So I focused a lot on just mapping out the different stages
                        and figuring out how we were going to manage the work within my team. So I would say, you know
                        if you're in a function like that, understanding that the volume will peak, the volume will
                        spike, it'll drop off. And so, you have to have some elasticity to move with the seasons. And so
                        the way I did that is by building in third party risk management or vendor security
                        responsibilities into a broad number of staff who are also responsible for other things like
                        application security, so that when we hit certain cycles, like the end of Q3, for example, the
                        end of Q3 was always a nightmare because everyone had money, they wanted to spend it quickly
                        we'd get a huge spike in volume. And so basically, everyone on the team would kind of drop what
                        they're doing and dogpile into the vendor security process to make sure we could move all those
                        requests efficiently. So that was one way.

                        Do you find that the different organizations interacting with that whole process have different
                        needs and demands, or I'm assuming that they do? And if that assumption is wrong, poke at it.
                        But do you find that those different competing demands and priorities make it difficult for a
                        process like that to run efficiently?

                        Yes, oftentimes, you know, they're under pressure for their line of business to deliver whatever
                        it is that they've been asked to deliver by the company. And it's not their job to be experts on
                        the security process. So they just may not know how to interact with the security team, and
                        maybe it's their first time. So oftentimes, timelines clash. Maybe they come to the security
                        team a week before they think they're going to resolve a purchase in 48 hours and realize it can
                        take a little bit longer than that. And that's unfortunate because it's not a position that we
                        want to be in. So I spend a lot of my time there trying to educate people on expectations of how
                        the process could go and how we could partner better. Because being in the security team, you
                        kind of end up in the position of being a blocker. And that's not the position I ever wanted to
                        be in; I was there to support the business and help them achieve their objectives safely.
                        Blocking them from doing something was not my goal.

                        Yeah, you're definitely hitting a hot button. I think that probably a lot of our listeners have
                        heard security is often seen as the ones who say no, when in fact, we want to say yes but. So
                        how would you go about doing that? In large enterprises, communication, even within a given team
                        or department, can sometimes be complex, let alone across departments or even across business

                        It starts in security leadership; oftentimes, leaders may focus on the technical problem they're
                        responsible for and not necessarily look outward to the business problems their colleagues are
                        trying to solve. I spent a lot of time meeting with the business leaders like the people in
                        charge of HR or sales, the ones running the company's various operations. I wanted to understand
                        the problems they were trying to solve and the timeline they were working against to solve those
                        problems.

                        At the beginning of the year, we had benefits refresh. The benefits department is like we're
                        redoing all the benefits across the entire company this year, knowing that it was like, okay at
                        the beginning of the year. This is a huge priority for the company; anytime we see something
                        from Benefits at the top of the pile, we will make sure that we're there to help them. And they became
                        really good partners and knew how to work with security, because we were proactively showing
                        them that we were willing to support them and help them. I think partnership came down to hey,
                        there's a security problem here; this company that you're looking at isn't as mature as we'd
                        like. They were more than willing to work with us because they saw how willing we were to work
                        with them every step of the way up until that point.

                        I love this idea you're getting at of establishing these relationships. And it's a theme that
                        does come up quite a bit here on this podcast. Security and tech, in general, are so technical,
                        complicated, scientific, and yet, so often, it boils down to building relationships and how do
                        we use those relationships to further the mission of the business. I'm curious to hear how you
                        think that one can build these relationships. It sounds like the things you were doing were
                        being proactive, setting up time in advance, not being reactive, asking questions, being an
                        active listener. Are those the basic principles for how you, as a security leader, built
                        relationships across the enterprise?

                        Yes, I would say that, and I always tried to focus on the accessibility of the security team,
                        me, and the resources that worked for me. Often, I think I see security leaders who focus on
                        their process, like I talked a lot about process building before. Sometimes people just focus on
                        their process and get tunnel vision and say, you have to go through my process. If you're not,
                        you're harming my ability to scale. So I won't talk to you. But that can be really frustrating
                        for people who are confused by your process, are new to it, or maybe don't understand it. So I
                        tried to find a bunch of avenues where people could engage our team in scalable ways where
                        perhaps they were confused. Some people just have a better time talking to someone than they do
                        writing an email. So we had a thing we called office hours where we had an app, anyone could hit
                        that app, choose a time during the week for 30 minutes slot and sit down with someone from my
                        team and just have a conversation about what their problem was and what they were trying to
                        achieve. And that was a really effective way, like a lot of people didn't use it. But for the
                        people who needed in-person conversations, it was their favorite thing.

                        That's really fascinating. So it sounds like the logistical and practical reality that different

                        ways as you can.

                        Yes, exactly. And then we would have a Slack channel and a self-service knowledge base, and kind
                        of a ticketing system, where if you're good at writing emails back and forth, that was great for
                        you. Engaging in all of these different channels pulls your focus a little bit and requires some
                        resourcing to maintain it. Still, it is much more approachable for our business partners and
                        makes the process easier for them.

                        I love it. You introduced a problem before that I hear a lot. And it's this idea that the

                        the security process might take weeks instead of right now. When one runs into that, how do we

                        Having a process that communicates early time expectations is important because some of these
                        things do take time. So one of the requirements that we had was for really sensitive vendors,
                        integrations to key systems, we had to do an in-house penetration test. And that takes time to
                        coordinate; it takes time to perform; it really can't just be done instantaneously. So we put a
                        lot of effort into educating people on the timelines for that process so that the minute they
                        talked to a sourcing partner and said, hey, we want to go and look at a solution. The first
                        thing that's said to the partner is okay, let's get this scheduled out. Because we know you're
                        going to need a penetration test in this category, let's get that planned in advance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        COVID is a great example. Because of COVID, we had to respond to emergencies; we needed testing
                        vendors; we needed medical vendors for the pandemic. There was no timeline in which we could
                        move quickly enough. So having a risk acception process, where an executive in the business can
                        say, I understand that I'm bypassing the process, I get it. The risk to the company is much
                        higher if we don't bypass this process and accept the risk, because he's doing something that
                        will buy down risk for the company in a more significant way than going through the process. And
                        then, you know, the process can always catch up later and close out that risk. But that outlet,
                        that kind of emergency outlet, and that flexibility from the security team are also important.

                        Yeah, I like it. I would imagine that something like that probably winds up getting used a lot,
                        then people become accustomed to this idea that there's always this emergency release valve.
                        Have you found historically that is something that winds up getting abused? I don't mean it in a
                        malicious way, like someone's intentionally circumventing the system. But the way business runs
                        today, everything is an emergency. So how do we help the stakeholders involved in this type of
                        decision distinguish between what's an emergency and something more of, you just want it right

                        Yeah, there is this tendency to gamify the system. If the exception process is seamless, quick,
                        and faster than the more secure process, then everyone's going to go for that. Their incentive
                        is, hey, this one moves much faster. So you have to make the exception process weighty enough
                        that it's not someone's first choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way I like to do that was by requiring kind of an in-depth write-up of the risk scenario
                        that we were going to make an exception for. And then having a VP level executive on the
                        business side and a VP executive on the security side sit down together and discuss that
                        write-up and the ramifications.

                    <p>
                        If someone more junior in the organization, like a director or a manager is requesting the
                        exception, they know that it's going to go up to their VP who is the one assuming the risk and
                        discussing it with someone from security. That helps them understand, oh, this is actually a
                        pretty impactful decision. I don't want my VP necessarily to feel like he has to sign off on
                        this because I didn't move quickly enough. So that drives the right behavior.

                        I think it was trial and error in a way, but also I like to listen to a lot of podcasts about
                        behavioral economics and learning about incentives and how people respond to them. You kind of
                        look at these systems and security and say, okay, what kind of behavior am I incentivizing? Many
                        processes and security are built so that people naturally want to bypass them. So you need to
                        build them so that it is natural for them to want to go down the best path for you. If you build
                        a process, and this is the thing that I want everyone to follow, you have to find ways to
                        improve it such that the majority of the company is going to want to follow that process versus
                        any other option.

                        Okay, that's cool. So let's explore that. Because we've just sort of talked about how do you
                        build a process in a way that makes people not always want to trigger the exception, always make
                        everything an emergency? So that's sort of a disincentive? What's an example of a process that
                        you built, even if it's a hypothetical one? How could we build a process, so someone says, I
                        want to do that?

                    <p>
                        Yeah, so I think I can even drag it back to the sort of the vendor security process when I zoom
                        back in time to earlier Salesforce days when it was more of a startup than a big
                        multibillion-dollar enterprise. But back then, when we had less formal processes in place, one
                        of the ways we got people to engage in our vendor security sort of program was saying, if you
                        follow this process, we'll work with you. We'll figure out a way to de-risk this situation and
                        sort of approve you to move forward as quickly as we can. If you don't follow this process, you
                        own everything about this vendor going forward. So if they have a breach, we are not going to be
                        there to help you because you bypassed our process. And that sort of partnership incentive where
                        they're like, oh, I don't want to be on my own if there's a problem, I want the security team's
                        help. That was not my favorite way of building a process and building an incentive structure.
                        But it worked really well, in getting people to work with us.

                        So we've been talking about this from the perspective within the enterprise itself. Getting the
                        vendors and third parties to participate in these programs, whether it's answering the
                        questionnaires or supplying their security testing reports, or meeting with you, there's often a
                        lot of resistance to that because it feels like more work. It feels like a barrier to
                        procurement, etc. How have you seen that we could build the process in ways that incentivize the
                        third party?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's a good one. I've been on the purchasing side for many years. And now I've spent a few
                        months on the selling side. And so I've seen both sides of it. And I think on both sides of it,
                        I've kind of come to the same philosophy, which is that transparency is the thing that I want to
                        see more than anything else. It is very difficult to judge the maturity of another company
                        without information, without the details you need. And even when you have details, it's not a
                        science; it's an art. So you want as many data points as you can get.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So for me, when I was at Salesforce, the thing that I would always come at was transparency.
                        When I talked to a vendor or prospective vendor, I would tell them that we're going to ask you
                        for all these details, you may not want to supply them, and that's okay. But I want you to know
                        that when you don't supply them, I'm immediately going to assume you don't have them. And that
                        will be counted against you. And it's kind of up to you how efficiently you want to pass this
                        process. You know, if you think we're going to conclude that you're super mature, without
                        providing us all these details, great, that's what we'll try. But if you don't provide them to
                        us, we have to conclude that you lack these kinds of policies and maturity; you're not fixing
                        your bugs quickly enough. That sort of thing versus like when we would work with the vendor who
                        is super transparent, share everything. It was like a dream. You're just like, I love you.
                        You're amazing. Let's partner together forever.

                    <p>
                        I think there's some really good examples out there of companies that have gotten much better at
                        transparency. I mean, one of my favorites is GitLab. GitLab is super transparent about
                        everything that they do. All their documentation is published publicly, which I think is
                        amazing.

                    <p>
                        Yeah, I love this theme that you're keyed in on here about transparency. I wrote a book called
                        Hackable, and it's written for people who build software systems, how to do it securely, but
                        then ultimately, the payoff is now how do you prove that to your customer? And I argue exactly
                        what you said here, which is transparency. And when you're more transparent, it's this
                        fascinating dichotomy, where the more transparent you are, even if you're saying I have
                        problems, look at all these vulnerabilities. And, it's going to take us this long in our roadmap
                        to fix them – that often builds more confidence in the relationship than the person who's like,
                        no, we're good, not applicable. We have military-grade encryption, that kind of stuff, right?

                        100%, yeah, it sort of feels like the bug bounty revolution, where now many companies are more
                        willing to allow external reporting of vulnerabilities. Acknowledging that we're going to have
                        problems, we need to build processes to recognize what those problems are and get them fixed
                        very quickly. And when we were doing penetration tests against companies, that's what we
                        measured against, it's not whether or not they had problems, but if we identified problems,
                        could they fix them?

                        So we would do a penetration test of a given vendor and keep an excellent technical staff of
                        people who could do good penetration testing. So that the odds of us finding bugs within a
                        vendor were pretty decent, not always like the most mature ones, it was very difficult. But most
                        of the time, we would find a few decent bugs in a software vendor. And then we give them to them
                        and say, here's what we found. And ask them for their SLAs on fixing these types of bugs. And
                        they would share them and say, we'll fix this one within 30 days, we'll fix this within 60 days,
                        great. And then we would let them work against their SLA and prove it to us. And you could
                        immediately tell if a company was not good at fixing bugs against some penalized delay because
                        they feel like we have a lot of priorities. This one's probably going to take us a year to fix,
                        and that was always a very bad sign.

                        Got it. Now, let's discuss the process itself of managing this. From the vendor having responses
                        to security questionnaires, those questionnaires, whether it's a questionnaire or some other
                        format information being communicated to an enterprise from the security team to the procurement
                        team, legal, business, whatever. Have you seen ways where that whole lifecycle and information
                        work well? And cases where it doesn't work? I know you've given us some tips already on sort of
                        both sides. But if you think about the whole process, breaking it up to this point into two sides,
                        inside the enterprise, and outside the enterprise, but now we think about it as a complete
                        process. Are there examples where people totally bungled it, or examples where it's gone
                        exceptionally well?

                        I think so. I've spoken to a lot of companies that have vendor security teams; I like to keep in
                        touch with a lot of them. And this is a pretty common problem across all of these companies,
                        which is the information sharing across all these key departments; it can be a struggle.
                        Especially in one company, you may have a really strong vendor security team, someone who gets
                        the process and is super engaged. But another participant in the process may not be as strong,
                        may not have been as funded as well. And so that piece becomes kind of a detractor, the drag on
                        the process, and sometimes with some companies, it's a security team, that's a drag. So I kind
                        of got the sense that wherever you go, there's always a gap here or there in the process, and
                        nobody has it 100% nailed amazingly well. So there's a lot of work to do.

                        Yeah, agreed. So it seems to me like there's a handful of ways people might solve that complex
                        problem in terms of the tools they use to communicate. On the more sophisticated end, there's
                        actual platforms built to manage this process. And on the lesser sophisticated end, people are
                        using email and spreadsheets. In your experience, do you think that enterprises are largely in
                        the use of tools or non-solutions, like email and spreadsheets? Or is it sort of somewhere in
                        between?

                        I would say that, among the security programs that I've talked to that focus on third parties,
                        the ones that have a unified sourcing platform are always in the best shape. There isn't a
                        centralized function at some companies that manages and has oversight of procurement; it can
                        happen willy nilly, anywhere. And that makes it hard for the security or legal team or any team
                        to be successful in that process. Because you're just fighting this visibility challenge, you're
                        not seeing everything. And then when you get that centralized procurement function, and
                        hopefully some piece of software that brings together the purchasing process, the main thing you
                        get is visibility. And it may not be the perfect solution from a security perspective or the
                        perfect solution from a legal perspective. But visibility is like the first key battle into
                        really getting your hands around your third-party security. You need to be able to see
                        everything to properly gauge the risk of what's coming into your organization.

                        I think there's a lot of cool innovation happening in this space, a lot of it in other
                        companies, and smart people are doing it. I really liked Dropbox's program; they were doing many
                        really innovative things, especially their bug bounty for vendors. So they blogged about this in
                        the past, in their bug bounty program, they have third parties included. They will pay
                        researchers to research products that they don't own because they've identified these products
                        as being impactful to the security of Dropbox. And I thought that was a really interesting way
                        to innovate in the third-party security space.

                        Super cool, awesome. Well, as our time comes to a close here, I definitely appreciate all these
                        insights. I've learned a lot from you as we go through this. And it's great to hear some of the
                        insights that you've shared. Any parting wisdom that you wanted to drop on our audience before
                        we close?

                <div class="pb-3">

                        Kyle Tobener
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        I would just plug third-party security, for some people, it doesn't seem like the sexiest area
                        to work in, in information security. But having done it for a number of years, I felt like it
                        was the thing that prepared me the most for jumping into the seesaw head of security role. It
                        taught me how to work with all these different business units across the company. It taught me
                        how to really oversee all different aspects of security and understand how to gauge a company's
                        security maturity. So if you have designs of becoming a broader security leader in the future,
                        spending some time in the third party risk space can really up-level you; it's kind of like an
                        MBA.
