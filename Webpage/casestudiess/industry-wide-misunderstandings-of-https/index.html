								<p>Most web browsers, historically, were cautious about caching content delivered over
									an HTTPS connection to disk—to a greater degree than required by the HTTP standard.
									In recent years, in response to the increased use of HTTPS for non-sensitive data,
									and the proliferation of bandwidth-hungry AJAX and Web 2.0 sites, some browsers have
									been changed to strictly follow the standard, and cache HTTPS content far more
									aggressively than before. HTTPS web servers must explicitly include a response
									header to block standards-compliant browsers from caching the response to disk—and
									not all web developers have caught up to the new browser behavior. ISE identified 21
									(70% of sites tested) financial, healthcare, insurance and utility account sites
									that failed to forbid browsers from storing cached content on disk, and as a result,
									after visiting these sites, unencrypted sensitive content is left behind on
									end-users' machines.</p>

								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>Users often visit the same web pages more than once, such as checking a news site
									every day. While some of the page contents may change often, the vast majority of
									the page and associated resources (such as images) never change. To re-download this
									unchanged content on every visit of the page would be a waste of time and bandwidth.
									To avoid this, when a user accesses a web page the web browser caches (saves a copy
									of) most content locally on the user's machine. This content can either be saved in
									temporary memory (RAM), which is lost as soon as the user exits the browser, or on
									disk, which persists after the user exits the browser or reboots the computer. When
									a user visits a previous page a second time, the content is retrieved from cache
									instead of over the Internet. Memory caches are lost when the browser exits, so the
									browser uses the disk cache whenever possible.</p>
								<p>Secure web sites use the HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt information as it
									travels over the Internet, to prevent an eavesdropper or man-in-the-middle from
									seeing or modifying the communication. Although there are no technical constraints
									preventing content sent over an encrypted connection from being decrypted and
									written to disk, it is logical to presume that if content is too sensitive to be
									sent over a network without encryption, then it may also be too sensitive to store
									unprotected on a hard drive. When HTTPS was first introduced, there was no standard,
									unambiguous way for a web server to mark content as too sensitive to store in cache.
									As a result, web browser authors created their own mechanisms for a web server to
									restrict disk caching <a href="#1d" name="1s">[1]</a>. Some browser authors chose
									to, by default, <i>never</i> write content transferred over HTTPS to disk <a
										href="#2d" name="2s">[2]</a>, or did not disk cache content unless a server
									header explicitly allowed it (“opt-in”) <a href="#3d" name="3s">[3]</a>, while
									others chose to write this content to the disk cache, unless a server header
									explicitly prohibited it (“opt-out”) <a href="#4d" name="4s">[4]</a>.</p>
								<p>In 1999, the HTTP/1.1 standard was published, which standardized the header <a
										href="#5d" name="5s">[5]</a> that a server must set to prevent content from
									being written to a disk cache. By that time, all web browser authors had already
									adopted either an opt-in HTTPS disk caching policy, or an opt-out policy with
									multiple, non-standard ways to opt out. Despite the new standard, web developers
									could continue to use the old, non-standard methods and they would continue to work
									only in the browsers that recognized them <a href="#1d" name="1s">[1]</a>.</p>
								<p>Between the release of Netscape Navigator 3.0 in 1996, and 2008, when Google Chrome
									was released, the only browser with a significant market share that used an
									“opt-out” HTTPS disk caching policy was Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer has
									always been very forgiving in determining a web server's intention that a response
									not be written to the disk cache. ISE identified four separate ways <a href="#1d"
										name="1s">[1]</a> that can a web developer can prevent a response from being
									cached to disk. Only one of those ways, the header Cache-Control: no-store, is
									actually standard <a href="#5d" name="5s">[5]</a>.</p>
								<p>Encrypted web servers (HTTPS) have higher overhead and lower performance than
									unencrypted servers due to the need to perform encryption, and in the past this
									overhead was much more pronounced. For this reason, many web sites used HTTPS only
									when absolutely necessary, such as for sending a password or credit card
									information. After the sensitive transaction was completed, the sites would switch
									back to an unencrypted connection. Two examples are Gmail, which transmitted e-mails
									over unencrypted connections until 2010 <a href="#6d" name="6s">[6]</a>, and
									Facebook, which continued to use unencrypted connections until 2012 <a href="#7d"
										name="7s">[7]</a>. Since HTTPS was reserved for only the most sensitive
									information, an opt-in disk caching policy was a very reasonable design.</p>
								<p>By 2011, many sites had begun using HTTPS even for non-sensitive content, and Mozilla
									Corporation recognized that the opt-in HTTPS disk caching policy in Firefox was
									introducing a performance penalty compared to other browsers, including Google
									Chrome, which uses an opt-out policy. As a result, Firefox 4.0 and all later
									versions use an opt-out HTTPS disk caching policy <a href="#8d" name="8s">[8]</a>. A
									Firefox 3.6 user would be unaffected by this issue, even when browsing HTTPS sites
									that fail to set the necessary header, but would become affected as soon as that
									user updated to Firefox 4 or later.</p>
								<p>Online banking, which is among the most security-sensitive uses of a web browser,
									exploded in popularity in the early 2000s. This was a time when Internet Explorer
									had over 90% market share, and before Safari and Chrome even existed. Internet
									Explorer's only significant competitors at the time (Netscape 3.0 and later,
									Mozilla, and Firefox) either did not disk cache HTTPS content at all (unless a user
									manually modified a configuration parameter), or used an opt-in policy, and thus
									required no special treatment to prevent caching of encrypted bank pages. Many of
									the web sites that we tested responded with sufficient headers to prevent caching in
									all versions of Internet Explorer, all versions of Safari, and Firefox 3.6 and
									earlier, but not Firefox 4.0 and later, or any version of Chrome. We believe that
									ensuring that sensitive content is not cached on disk by the browser was a design
									goal in these web applications. While this anti-disk cache functionality worked
									correctly in the past, it no longer works in two of today's popular browsers:
									Chrome, and Firefox 4.0 and later. Since this has been an issue in Chrome since its
									release in 2008, and in Firefox since 2011, the maintainers of these sites do not
									appear to perform regression testing for this issue.</p>
								<p>Today, Internet Explorer continues to follow the same HTTPS disk caching policy as it
									always has: enable disk caching by default, but allow four different ways to disable
									it. Google Chrome and Firefox, in contrast, enable disk caching by default, but
									allow only one way to prevent it—the one given in the standard, the header
									Cache-Control: no-store.</p>
								<p>Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, together, now have over a 60% market share on
									non-mobile devices <a href="#9d" name="9s"
										data-wplink-edit="true">[9]</a>, but many web sites still use antiquated,
									non-standard methods to prevent disk caching of sensitive HTTPS content that only
									function in Internet Explorer.</p>

								<h2>Caching Policies by Browser</h2>
								<p>Disk caching of HTTPS-delivered web pages varies by web browser. Below are the
									policies of four browsers that we tested.</p>
								<p><b>Internet Explorer.</b> Microsoft Internet Explorer caches HTTPS-delivered content
									to disk, unless one or more of the following are present <a href="#1d">[1]</a>:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The HTTP header <b>Cache-Control: no-store</b>.</li>
									<li>The HTTP header <b>Cache-Control: no-cache</b>.</li>
									<li>The HTTP header <b>Pragma: no-cache</b>.</li>
									<li>The HTML tag <b>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Pragma" CONTENT="no-cache"&gt;</b>.
										Microsoft discourages the use of this method; it may not work properly for pages
										larger than 32 kilobytes <a href="#10d" name="10s">[10]</a>.</li>
								</ul>
								<p> </p>
								<p>Note that the Cache-Control header <b>cannot</b> be set using an HTML &lt;META
									HTTP-EQUIV&gt; tag. Additionally, Internet Explorer interprets some of these headers
									differently, depending upon whether the page was delivered using HTTPS or HTTP.</p>
								<p>ISE verified that this behavior as described using the 32-bit version of Internet
									Explorer 10.0.9200.16576 on 64-bit Windows 7.</p>
								<p><b>Firefox.</b> Prior to version 4.0, Mozilla Firefox (and its predecessors,
									including Mozilla and Netscape) either <i>never</i> cache HTTPS pages to disk at
									all, or cache only pages sent with:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The HTTP header <b>Cache-Control: public</b>.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Firefox contains a hidden browser preference,
									<code>browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl</code>, that when set to <code>true</code>,
									switches Firefox from the previous, cautious policy above, to a new policy that
									strictly follows the HTTP standard, disk caching all content unless specifically
									instructed not to do so by the server. In 2011, the default value of this preference
									was switched from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> <a href="#8d">[8]</a>. As
									a result, Firefox 4.0 and all later versions cache HTTPS-delivered content to disk,
									unless the following is present:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The HTTP header <b>Cache-Control: no-store</b>.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>ISE verified that using the 32-bit version of Mozilla Firefox 3.6.28 on 64-bit
									Windows 7 (and earlier), HTTPS content is not disk cached unless the server sends
									the <b>Cache-Control: public</b> header. ISE verified that using the 32-bit version
									of Mozilla Firefox 21.0 on 64-bit Windows 7, Mozilla Firefox 21.0 on Mac OS X
									10.7.5, and Mozilla Firefox 21.0 on Android 2.3.6, HTTPS content is disk cached
									unless the server sends the <b>Cache-Control: no-store</b> header.</p>
								<p><b>Chrome.</b> Google Chrome caches HTTPS-delivered content to disk, unless the
									following is present:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The HTTP header <b>Cache-Control: no-store</b>.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>ISE verified that using Google Chrome 27.0.1453.94m on Windows 7, and the Browser app
									in Android 2.3.6 (which is based on Chrome), HTTPS content is disk cached unless the
									server sends the <b>Cache-Control: no-store</b> header.</p>
								<p><b>Safari.</b> Apple Safari does <b>not</b> cache HTTPS-delivered content to disk,
									regardless of any headers sent by the server. ISE tested the mobile version of
									Safari on an iPad 2, and the HTTPS caching behavior was identical to the desktop
									version.</p>
								<p>ISE verified that using Safari 6.0 (7536.25) on Mac OS X 10.7.5, and Mobile Safari on
									iOS 5.1.1, HTTPS content is never disk cached.</p>
								<p><i>A word about private browsing modes.</i> Virtually all web browsers now include a
									“private browsing” mode, that in addition to preventing browsing history from being
									retained, disables the disk cache entirely. While sufficient for a user to avoid
									this issue, we do not consider advising users to use private browsing to be a
									reasonable solution for several reasons. First, private browsing modes are not the
									default, and must manually be enabled by a user. Second, other aspects of private
									browsing, such as not retaining persistent cookies, break useful functionality in
									web sites, such as remembering usernames or remembering the computer to avoid
									answering security questions on each login. Third, since private browsing disables
									the disk cache entirely, it has negative side effects on the performance of the
									Internet as a whole, since even unencrypted HTTP content must be re-downloaded if
									the browser has been closed.</p>

								<h2>Site Survey</h2>
								<h3>Methodology</h3>
								<p>ISE tested thirty secure, password-protected sites that displayed sensitive personal
									information in a web browser. This involved accessing SSL-protected websites as an
									authorized user, logging out of the site, and closing the Firefox browser. Then, ISE
									reopened the browser, placed it in offline mode, and checked the disk cache for
									entries containing sensitive data.</p>
								<h3>Initial Results</h3>
								<p>As of April 25, 2013, twenty-one of the thirty sites tested were not sending the
									<b>Cache-Control: no-store</b> header required by the HTTPS standard to prevent disk
									caching of sensitive data. Some were not sending any caching-related headers at all,
									while others were sending caching headers that prevent disk caching only in Internet
									Explorer, or other headers not relevant to web browser caches.
								</p>
								<p>The following sites sent sensitive information with both of the headers
									Cache-Control: no-cache, and Pragma: no-cache, which prevent disk caching in
									Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome:</p>

								<h3>Updates</h3>
								<p>We notified each company by email to the security– or phishing–related email address,
									or when email was not available, using a web-based contact form. The following
									companies acknowledged our advisories with a non-automated response:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Argus Health</li>
									<li>M &amp; T Bank</li>
									<li>PayPal</li>
								</ol>
								<p>The following companies have made at least some progress in correcting the issue:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>BB&amp;T. The account summary page is now sending Cache-Control: no-store, but
										check images are still sent with inadequate protections.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Observations and Concerns</h3>
								<p>We believe that the amount of personal data that is currently being written to the
									disk cache when visiting these sites is alarming. It is important to note, however,
									the distinction between a user consciously selecting a "save to disk" option, e.g.,
									to save a bank statement, and content silently being written to the disk cache
									without users' knowledge. Non-technical users likely believe that if, after visiting
									a site and viewing personal data, they logout and close their browsers, that their
									data will be safe. Our findings prove this assumption incorrect in 70% of the cases
									tested.</p>
								<p>Based on the quantity of sites (twelve of twenty-one) that sent at least one
									cache-related header, even if it was not the one mandated by the standard to prevent
									disk caching, we do not believe that it is intended by these industries that this
									content be written to the disk cache. More significantly, the maintainers of these
									sites may erroneously believe that they have set the required headers to prevent
									disk caching, based on outdated and incorrect information published on the Internet.
									One tutorial <a href="#11d" name="11s">[11]</a> correctly states the purpose of all
									of these headers, but does not put them in the proper context with regard to HTTPS,
									stating “SSL pages are not cached (or decrypted) by proxy caches,” which, while true
									for proxies, does not address the behavior of browsers. An OWASP page <a href="#12d"
										name="12s">[12]</a> incorrectly asserts that “If a web page is delivered over
									SSL, no content can be cached.” When even the security community makes outdated and
									incorrect assumptions about this issue, it is unrealistic that more
									generally-focused web developers will do better.</p>
								<p>Web browser authors, with the most striking example being Mozilla, seem unconcerned
									with shifting the responsibility of discretion as to which HTTPS pages are safe to
									disk cache to the server. A comment on the bug report involving the change to
									Firefox 4's SSL caching policy by a member of Mozilla Corporation's security team
									stated “Among sites that don't use cache-control:no-store, the correlation between
									"SSL" and "sensitive" is very low” <a href="#8d">[8]</a>. Our findings show that
									this assertion does not hold when real-world sites are examined, even two years
									after the change.</p>
								<p>The fact that the unencrypted, disk cached data is only stored on the user's personal
									machine should not be discounted. The possibilities for this information to be
									exposed are numerous: malware infections, theft of laptops and mobile devices, theft
									of physical backup media or compromise of “cloud” backup services, shared machines
									and user accounts, and of course, shared computers in libraries, hotels, and
									Internet cafes. An Intel-sponsored Ponemon Institute study estimated the cost of
									recovering from the loss or theft of a single laptop as $49,246 <a href="#13d"
										name="13s">[13]</a>, and a Lookout Mobile Security study estimated that lost and
									stolen phones cost consumers more than $30 billion in 2012 <a href="#14d"
										name="14s">[14]</a>.</p>

								<h3>Recommendations</h3>
								<p><b>To Web Developers and Web Framework Authors.</b> Developers of web applications
									and web frameworks should audit all existing code to ensure that sensitive data is
									appropriately labeled with caching directives. Professionals in these fields must
									become more familiar with the fine details of the HTTP standard, and assume that
									browser software will always make performance vs. security trade-offs against
									security. Proper security assessments of sites containing sensitive information
									should be conducted regularly, and an examination of disk cached content across all
									supported browsers should be part of that assessment process.</p>
								<p><b>To the Security Community.</b> All existing guidance and advice in regard to the
									HTTPS caching issue should be revised to reflect the reality of the HTTP standard.
									Security professionals should be cautious in making assertions or recommendations
									based on working knowledge alone, and be sure to consult the relevant standards and
									perform testing to back up their beliefs.</p>
								<p><b>To Web Browser Authors.</b> In a time where security threats and identity theft
									are rampant, all browsers should adopt an opt-in only policy for caching sensitive
									data to disk; and further, users should have an easily accessible option to refuse
									any or all opt-in directives. At the very least, we recommend that browsers with a
									very strict opt-out HTTPS disk caching policy, such as Firefox and Chrome, consider
									interpreting the HTTP headers and meta tag introduced by Internet Explorer, as well.
									Internet Explorer has been disk caching HTTPS content for far longer than either of
									these browsers, so many sites seem to have been developed with IE-centric security
									assumptions in mind.</p>
								<p><b>To End-Users.</b> Users should make the following configuration changes, depending
									on each browser:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><b>Internet Explorer.</b> Internet explorer already abides by most web
										application attempts to prevent disk caching. To further restrict what can be
										cached, a user can open Internet Options, choose the Advanced tab, and under
										Security, check “Do not save encrypted pages to disk”. This option may have
										unwanted side effects, such as interfering with file downloads from HTTPS sites
										<a href="#4d">[4]</a>. Alternatively, use InPrivate Browsing
										mode.
									</p>
									<p><b>Firefox.</b> Install <a
											href="../../research/https-disk-cache-controller-browser-extensions/index.html">our
											“HTTPS Caching Controller”</a> Firefox add-on, which adds a toolbar button
										allowing disk caching of SSL content to be disabled or enabled at any time. This
										add-on works only on the desktop version of Firefox. Manually, or on the mobile
										version, navigate to <code>about:config</code>, enter the preference
										<code>browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl</code>, and double-click to switch the value
										from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>. Alternatively, use Private
										Browsing mode.
									</p>
									<p><b>Chrome.</b> ISE could not locate any settings in Chrome to easily limit disk
										caching of HTTPS requests. Instead, use Incognito mode.</p>
									<p><b>Safari.</b> Safari users (both desktop and mobile) need not take any action,
										since, as of this writing, Safari does not cache any content transferred over
										HTTPS.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>In addition to taking these precautions, never log into account-related or other
									security-sensitive sites from a computer or other device you do not own and control.
